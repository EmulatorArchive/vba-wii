= Setup & Installation =

Download the latest version from the [http://code.google.com/p/vba-wii/downloads/list Downloads page]. Unzip the archive. You will find the following folders inside:

 * apps - Contains Homebrew Channel ready files (see Homebrew Channel instructions below)
 * executables - Contains Gamecube / Wii DOL files (for loading from other methods)
 * vbagx - Contains the directory structure required for storing roms and saves. By default, roms are loaded from "vbagx/roms/" and saves / preferences are stored in "vbagx/saves/".

== Wii - Via the Homebrew Channel ==

The most popular method of running homebrew on the Wii is through the [http://hbc.hackmii.com/ Homebrew Channel]. If you already have the channel installed, just copy over the apps folder
included in the archive into the root of your SD card.

Remember to also create the vbagx directory structure required. See above.

== GameCube == 

You can load VBAGX via sdload and an SD card in slot A, or by streaming 
it to your Gamecube, or by booting a bootable DVD with VBAGX on it. 
This document doesn't cover how to do any of that. A good source for information 
on these topics is the [http://www.tehskeen.com/forums/ TehSkeen Forums].
